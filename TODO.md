## Instructions

### MOV
 - Finish Address Modes, address in register and SP relative addressing.

## 1-Cycle Execution
It is possible to perform most operations in one cycle but control unit
complexity rises very high, at this moment i've decided to keep it simple and
make it work with 2 cycles per op by default.

## Microcode
Can it be done?
